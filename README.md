# dsd-cohort-summer-2025

This is the repository for your team project in the **Dallas Software Developers Group (DSD) Summer 2025 Cohort**. It's your responsibility to maintain this documentation as you start to define your problem space, and technology stack.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Your cohort leads are:

- Miguel Chateloin (@migsch on Discord)

Your tickets are managed in Jira. The two most important interfaces are:

- **The board** where you'll see your currently assigned tickets for your 1-week sprints. [Link](https://dsd-cohort-summer-2025.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CHRT/boards/1)
- **The backlog** where you'll see all the tickets at once that have been created for the project. [Link](https://dsd-cohort-summer-2025.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CHRT/boards/1/backlog). 

It will be up to you to create Jira tickets, commit your code, and handle pull requests. Make sure to read these guidelines so you're set up for success:

- [JIRA Ticket Writing Guidelines](../../wiki/JIRA-Ticket-Writing-Guidelines)
